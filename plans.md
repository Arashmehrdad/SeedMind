# SeedMind Current Plan

This is the single live continuation file for ongoing SeedMind work.

Update this file in place as work progresses. Do not create or update session handover files unless Arash explicitly asks to move to a new session.

## Repository

- Alias: `seedmind`
- Local path: `D:\Github\SeedMind`
- Branch: `main`
- Latest completed batch: Batch 8 — explicit training-review and non-training bypass gate
- Inspect Git history for the current commit hash.
- Push policy: never push automatically

## Current stage

- Stage: Bounded Imagination
- Stage status: active
- Expanded developmental architecture marker: 82%

Completed bounded increments:

1. Batch 1 — caller-supplied exact-source imagined consequence traces.
2. Batch 2 — deterministic exact-record imagined candidate enumeration.
3. Batch 3 — pure per-step, per-dimension need-alignment annotation.
4. Batch 4 — deterministic caller-order pairwise route comparison.
5. Batch 5 — deterministic unresolved-comparison uncertainty audit.
6. Batch 6 — deterministic caller-nominated safe-experiment proposal contracts.
7. Batch 7 — deterministic explicit human approve, reject, or defer review.
8. Batch 8 — deterministic training-review or explicit configured non-training bypass resolution.

## Current accepted boundary

All bounded imagination outputs remain:

- explicitly `ExperienceOrigin.IMAGINED`;
- in memory only;
- deterministic and finite;
- provenance-preserving;
- non-evidentiary;
- non-authoritative.

The subsystem may represent exact imagined traces, enumerate exact supported candidates, annotate need alignment, describe pairwise route relations, expose unresolved comparison reasons, preserve caller-supplied safe-experiment proposal semantics, record optional training-time human review, and resolve an explicit configured non-training review bypass without autonomous recommendation or execution.

It must not:

- create factual evidence;
- change confidence, mastery, competence, growth pressure, replay evidence, or real-observation state;
- create a hidden route utility or arbitrary cross-effect total;
- globally rank candidates;
- select a winner;
- recommend, optimise, schedule, promote, or execute an action;
- persist imagination state;
- integrate with the live Nursery loop;
- influence production curiosity or production actions.

Unknown evidence, low-confidence evidence, route-depth mismatch, and explicit trade-offs block unsupported dominance claims.

## Current validation baseline

After Batch 8:

```text
ruff format --check .: 225 files already formatted
ruff check .: passed
mypy: no issues in 225 source files
pytest -q: 891 passed
pip check: no broken requirements
git diff --check: passed
```

- `docs/architecture/decisions/ADR-2026-06-29-explicit-training-review-gate-policy.md`

## Next planning target

Audit and close the bounded-imagination stage at Batch 8. The stage now has an explicit training-review path and an explicit configured non-training bypass path, both remaining non-executing and non-authoritative.

Do not add an experiment permit, scheduler, executor, persistence, live Nursery integration, autonomous promotion, recommendation, or production action path unless Arash separately approves that stronger boundary.

## Working rules

- Inspect repository status and this file before starting a new batch.
- Implement small bounded tasks directly through CodexBridge when practical.
- Use Codex CLI only when its overhead is justified.
- Run focused checks during implementation and full repository gates before closure.
- Refresh repository wiki and repository-scoped decision memory at completed batch boundaries.
- Create one bounded local commit per completed batch.
- Do not push automatically.
- Do not create a session handover unless Arash explicitly requests one because the session is ending or becoming too heavy.
